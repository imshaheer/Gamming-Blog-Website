# Basic-Gamming-Blog-Website
I've created a simple mobile gaming blog website with three short blogs about popular mobile games: Clash Royale, PUBG Mobile, and Among Us. Each blog has a heading, a brief description of the game, and a link to the official website of the game.

You can add more blogs by duplicating the "div class="blog"" section and modifying the game details accordingly. Remember to update the numbering for each blog.

Feel free to customize the styles and content according to your preferences. This is just a basic starting point, and you can expand and enhance it further based on your specific requirements.
